⚠️ Risk Analysis:
Criteria	Evaluation
Broad Permissions?	✅ Yes — Reads and changes data on all websites

Potential for Abuse?	✅ Yes — Can monitor or manipulate all website data
Memory/Performance Impact?	❌ Low (< 1MB) but risk lies in access, not size

✅ Actions Taken:
Opened Chrome Extension Manager
Reviewed permissions and description
Checked reviews (separately from Chrome Web Store)
Mixed user feedback — some report it stops working; few mention pop-up ads
Identified as potentially risky due to broad permissions
Removed the extension as it was not essential and posed privacy risks
Restarted Chrome
Observed slight performance improvement (faster tab switching, fewer pop-ups)

🔍 Research: How Malicious Extensions Harm Users
Data Theft: Intercept user input, cookies, saved passwords
Redirection: Hijack search engines or add pop-up ads
Backdoor Access: Open gateways for more malware
Tracking: Collect browsing behavior and sell it to third parties

🧠 Key Learnings / Tips:
Always check permissions before installing extensions.
Avoid extensions that can read/change data on all sites unless absolutely trusted.
Regularly audit your installed extensions — remove anything unused.
Stick to extensions with high ratings and many users.
Disable unnecessary site access from the extension settings.
Keep your browser updated to detect and block malicious add-ons.

🔐 Password & Security Tie-in:
Although not directly about passwords, extension risks relate to web-based password theft, especially when an extension can read login forms. Use strong, unique passwords and avoid inputting sensitive data while suspicious extensions are active.

✅ Final Outcome:
One extension reviewed and removed (Volume Master).
Browser security improved by eliminating potential privacy risk.
Gained hands-on awareness of managing browser extensions safely.
